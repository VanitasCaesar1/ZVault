description: What is ZVault and why should you use it?
---

ZVault is an **AI-native secrets manager**. It sits between your IDE's AI assistant and your secrets, ensuring LLMs can build your app without ever seeing your actual keys.

## The Problem

Every time you use Cursor, Copilot, or any AI coding tool, your `.env` file is in the context window. That means your API keys, database passwords, and tokens are being sent to third-party LLM providers.

```bash
# Your .env file — visible to every AI tool
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_51J3...
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:s3cret@prod-db:5432/app
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG...
```

## The Solution

ZVault replaces real values with `zvault://` references. The AI sees the reference, never the value.

```bash
# .env.zvault — safe for AI, safe for git
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=zvault://myapp/stripe-key
DATABASE_URL=zvault://myapp/database-url
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=zvault://myapp/aws-secret
```

When you run your app, ZVault resolves the references and injects the real values:

```bash
zvault run -- npm run dev
# All zvault:// URIs resolved, real env vars injected, app starts normally
```

## Key Features

- **Single binary** — no Docker, no Java, no runtime dependencies
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — military-grade, at rest and in transit
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing** — split your master key across multiple holders
- **MCP Server** — AI tools query secret metadata without seeing values
- **IDE integration** — one command setup for Cursor, Kiro, Continue
- **Full audit trail** — every access logged with HMAC integrity
- **Zero-trust architecture** — sealed by default, explicit unseal required
